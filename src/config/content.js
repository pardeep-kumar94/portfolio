    aboutMe: `Hello! I'm Pardeep. Over the past 8 years, I've delved deep into the tech world, constantly learning and experimenting. My journey began in 2015 as a freelance Android Developer. Throughout my career, I've collaborated with startups, fostering rapid learning and resilience in high-pressure environments. My passion lies in crafting mobile apps that strike a balance between aesthetics and robust engineering. If I were to pinpoint what I enjoy most, it would be conducting Code Reviews and addressing performance issues.`,
